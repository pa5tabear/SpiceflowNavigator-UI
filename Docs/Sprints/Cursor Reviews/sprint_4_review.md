# Sprint 4 Review - Real-time Dashboard Foundation Complete

## Progress & Status
**Target**: Complete real-time status indicators, content feed, and WebSocket integration  
**Achieved**: ❌ No delivery - Sprint 4 plan not executed  
**Status**: Sprint 4 INCOMPLETE - same delivery gap as Sprint 3  

## Green Badges & Metrics
**CI Status**: ✅ Existing tests still passing (5/5 from Sprint 2)  
**Coverage**: No change - still testing basic UI foundation only  
**LOC Delta**: 0 new lines - no Sprint 4 implementation detected  
**Guard-Rails**: N/A - no development activity to evaluate  

## Demo-able Capability
**User Experience**: Unchanged from Sprint 2 - basic Streamlit navigation only  
**Missing Features**: No status bar, no content feed, no WebSocket client - all Sprint 4 deliverables absent  
**Current State**: `streamlit run app.py` shows Goals/Results/Settings navigation (Sprint 2 level)  
**Impact**: Two consecutive sprint failures blocking world-class dashboard progression  

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
**Blockers**: Persistent execution gap - Codex not implementing real-time dashboard plans  
**Costs**: Two lost sprint cycles - significant delay to 4-phase roadmap  
**Risks**: CRITICAL - world-class dashboard vision at risk without foundation delivery  

## Failing CI Steps
**Status**: No CI failures - but also no new CI runs for Sprint 4 features  
**Missing Tests**: No `test_realtime_dashboard` tests implemented as required  

## TODOs Merged
No TODO tags found - no new development activity to review

## Decisions Needed
• **Execution Strategy**: Different approach needed - current plans not being implemented  
• **Codex Blockers**: What prevents real-time feature implementation - WebSocket complexity?  
• **Sprint Scope**: Should we simplify to basic status display before real-time features?  
• **Timeline Recovery**: How to recover two-sprint delay in world-class dashboard roadmap?

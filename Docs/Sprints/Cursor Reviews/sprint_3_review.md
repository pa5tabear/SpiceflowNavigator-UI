# Sprint 3 Review - Real-time Agent Dashboard Foundation

## Progress & Status
**Target**: Real-time agent status indicators, content feed structure, WebSocket foundation  
**Achieved**: ❌ No delivery - Sprint 3 plan not executed  
**Status**: Sprint 3 INCOMPLETE - no new code or tests implementing real-time features  

## Green Badges & Metrics
**CI Status**: ✅ Existing tests still passing (5/5 from Sprint 2)  
**Coverage**: No change - still testing basic UI foundation only  
**LOC Delta**: 0 new lines - no Sprint 3 implementation detected  
**Guard-Rails**: N/A - no development activity to evaluate  

## Demo-able Capability
**User Experience**: Same as Sprint 2 - basic Streamlit navigation only  
**Missing Features**: No real-time status bar, no content feed, no WebSocket connection  
**Current State**: `streamlit run app.py` shows Goals/Results/Settings navigation (Sprint 2 level)  
**Gap**: Zero progress toward world-class dashboard vision  

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
**Blockers**: Sprint 3 plan not executed by Codex - no code delivery  
**Costs**: Lost sprint cycle - no progress toward real-time capabilities  
**Risks**: HIGH - falling behind 4-phase roadmap schedule for world-class dashboard  

## Failing CI Steps
**Status**: No CI failures - but also no new CI runs for Sprint 3 features  
**Missing Tests**: No `test_realtime_foundation` tests implemented as required  

## TODOs Merged
No TODO tags found - no new development activity to review

## Decisions Needed
• Should Sprint 3 be re-executed with the real-time agent dashboard plan?  
• Are there blockers preventing Codex from implementing WebSocket features?  
• Should we adjust Sprint 4 timeline to account for Sprint 3 re-execution?

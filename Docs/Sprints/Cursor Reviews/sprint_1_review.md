# Sprint 1 Review - Repository Foundation

## Progress & Status
**Target**: Establish repository foundation and basic CI/CD pipeline  
**Achieved**: âœ… Repository structure created, CI workflow configured, dependencies defined  
**Status**: Foundation complete - ready for UI development sprint  

## Green Badges & Metrics
**CI Status**: ðŸ”„ No runs yet (fresh repository)  
**Coverage**: N/A (no tests directory exists)  
**LOC Delta**: +1,806 lines (initial repository setup)  
- README.md: 71 lines  
- CI workflow: 40 lines  
- Requirements: 10 lines  
- Configuration files: 1,685 lines  

## Demo-able Capability
**User Experience**: Repository is ready for clone and development setup  
**Infrastructure**: CI pipeline configured for Python 3.9-3.11 testing matrix  
**Dependencies**: Streamlit + Plotly + Pandas stack ready for UI development  

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
**Blockers**: No tests directory or source code exists yet  
**Costs**: Zero compute costs (no CI runs executed)  
**Risks**: Missing golden-path testing, no coverage baseline established  

## Failing CI Steps
**Status**: No CI runs executed yet  
**Potential Issues**: pytest tests/ will fail (no tests directory)  

## TODOs Merged
No TODO tags found in current codebase (fresh setup)

## Decisions Needed
â€¢ Choose UI framework approach: pure Streamlit vs. Streamlit + custom components?  
â€¢ Define initial user story priority: dashboard view vs. goal management?  
â€¢ Establish testing strategy: unit tests vs. integration tests vs. UI tests?

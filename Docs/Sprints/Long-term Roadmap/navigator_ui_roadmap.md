## 🔄 Agent Integration Architecture

### **Real-time Communication Flow**
```
Navigator-Pipeline (Orchestrator)
       ↓ WebSocket Events
Navigator-UI Dashboard
       ↑ Status Requests
       │
       ├─ Navigator-Ingest Events
       │  • content_discovered
       │  • processing_started  
       │  • processing_completed
       │
       ├─ Navigator-Strategy Events
       │  • analysis_started
       │  • analysis_completed
       │  • insights_generated
       │
       └─ Navigator-Pipeline Events
          • system_status_change
          • error_alerts
          • performance_metrics
```

### **Key WebSocket Event Types**
- `ingest:content_discovered` → Show new content notification
- `ingest:processing_started` → Update content status to "processing"
